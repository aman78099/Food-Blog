    <h1>pancake recipe</h1>
<p>
    Ingredients: <br>

    - flour <br>

    - baking powder <br>
    
    - sugar <Br>
    
    - egg <br>
    
    - milk <br>
</p>

<p>
    Instructions: <br>
    Preheat oven to 200Â°F. Have a baking sheet or heatproof <br>
    platter ready to keep cooked pancakes warm in the oven. <br>
    <br>

    In a small bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking <br>
    powder, and salt; set aside. <br>
    <br>
    In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, butter (or oil), and egg. <br>
    <br>
    Add dry ingredients to milk mixture; whisk until just moistened.<br>
    (Do not overmix; a few small lumps are fine.)<br>
    <br>
    Heat a large skillet (nonstick or cast-iron) or griddle over medium.<br>
    Fold a sheet of paper towel in half, and moisten with oil; carefully<br>
    rub skillet with oiled paper towel.<br>
    <br>
    For each pancake, spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter onto skillet,  <br>
    using the back of the spoon to spread batter into a round (you should <br>
    be able to fit 2 to 3 in a large skillet).<br>
    <br>
    Cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles and a few have burst, <br>
    1 to 2 minutes.<br>
    <br>
    Transfer to a baking sheet or platter; cover loosely with aluminum foil,<br>
    and keep warm in oven while you cook. Continue with more oil and<br>
    remaining batter. (You'll have 12 to 15 pancakes.) Serve warm, with<br>
    desired toppings. <br>
