    <br>
    - ¼ cup garlic chives , finely chopped* <br>
    <br>

    <!--In structions for the pancakes -->
    Instructions: <br>
    Shiitake Mushroom: Place the mushrooms in a bowl and pour over plenty of boiled water. <br>
    Leave for 20 minutes or until rehydrated. Squeeze out excess water, then finely chop<br>
    Cabbage: Place cabbage in a bowl with salt. Toss with fingers, then set aside for 15 <br>
    minutes. Squeeze out excess liquid from cabbage using hands.<br>
    Filling: Place cabbage, mushrooms and remaining Filling ingredients in a bowl. Mix <br>
    with your hands until well combined.<br>
    Peel one wrapper off and place on the palm of your left hand (if right handed). <br>
    Dip your finger in water and run it along half the edge of the wrapper.    <br>
    Place 1 heaped tablespoon of Filling in the centre. Fold wrapper over, then pleat to seal. <br>
    Alternatively, just press together with no pleats.<br>
    Finish so the dumpling is curved slightly, see photos in post, with the pleats on the top.<br>
    Place on tray. Cover with cling wrap or wet tea towel (important). Repeat with remaining dumplings.<br>
    Should make 30, if yours are extremely plump you may only make 25.<br>
    Make sure your pan has a lid that fits it half decently.<br>
    Heat 2 tsp oil in a non stick pan over medium high heat. Add dumplings, pressing down firmly to <br>
    flatten the base onto the pan. Cook around 8 to 10 per batch.<br>
    When the base is golden brown (check them), add 1/2 cup of water into the pan.<br>
    Immediately clamp the lid on, then leave for 7 minutes (any less and the pleats won’t be cooked <br>
    through so if your water dries out, add a bit more).<br>
    Remove lid – most of the water should be evaporated, the pleats should be cooked through. <br>
    Leave the pan on the stove until the base dries and the underside of the dumplings are once <br>
    again crisp. Remove dumplings from pan and transfer to serving plate. Repeat with remaining Dumplings. <br>
    Serve with Dipping Sauces of choice. <br>
