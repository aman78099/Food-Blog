    <h1>pancake recipe</h1>
<p>
    Ingredients: <br>

    - 1/2 cup plain yoghurt , full fat <br>
    - 1 tbsp lemon juice<br>
    - 1 tsp tumeric powder<br>
    - 2 tsp garam masala (Note 1)<br>
    - 1/2 tsp chilli powder or cayenne pepper powder (Note 2)<br>
    - 1 tsp ground cumin<br>
    - 1 tbsp ginger, freshly grated<br>
    - 2 cloves garlic, crushed<br>
    - 1.5 lb / 750 g chicken thigh fillets, cut into bite size pieces<br>
</p>

<p>
    Instructions: <br>
    Optional blitz: for an extra smooth sauce, combine the Marinade ingredients <br>
    (except the chicken) in a food processor and blend until smooth. (I do not do this)<br>
    <br>
    Marinade: Combine the Marinade ingredients with the chicken in a bowl. Cover and<br>
     refrigerate overnight, or up to 24 hours (minimum 3 hrs).<br>
    <br>
    Cook chicken: Heat the ghee (butter or oil) over high heat in a large fry pan.<br>
     Take the chicken out of the Marinade but do not wipe or shake off the marinade <br>
     from the chicken (but don’t pour the Marinade left in the bowl into the fry pan). <br>
    <br>
    Place chicken in the fry pan and cook for around 3 minutes, or until the chicken <br>
    is white all over (it doesn’t really brown because of the Marinade).<br>
    <br>
    Sauce: Add the tomato passata, cream, sugar and salt. Also add any remaining <br>
    marinade left in the bowl. Turn down to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Do a <br>
    taste test to see if it needs more salt.<br>
    <br>
    Garnish with coriander/cilantro leaves if using. Serve with basmati rice.<br>
    The Butter Chicken is pictured with my very easy No Yeast Flatbread and <br>
    no-fry papadums (Note 5).<br>
