## Feedfoward from others before the final outcome
### Design 
I designed simple white buttons with no effect. The main \
purpose of the buttons is to toggle between pages so I \
I didn't add too much detail to the buttons.

### Development
I added simple buttons to help the user navigate through \
different pages. This ensured that user would be able to \
explore and know about the website. They would start with \
the home page and then using the buttons be able to swtich \
to Search page, About page or Sponsors page. My buttons \
are white small because I want a simply and clean look. \
using css code I made the width small a 5% and the height \
at 4%. I set background as white and didn't add any borders.

### Testing
As a part of my testing I interviewed Allan and he \
that my design did not match the rest of my website \
He stated that my buttons looked simple and outdated, \
and it didn't match the theme of nature an organic. \
He also added by saying that the buttons look small \
and made the website's appearence weird.

### Improved
Listening to allan made me realise that my website \
locked too simply and outdated. I decided to improve by \
firstly redesigning the buttons and making them \
responsive. I made them green to match with the theme \
and I also added a grey side bar. This made it easier to \
navigate through the website and matched the general \
theme of the website.

---------------------------------------------------------

### Design 
I added a few pictures and arranged them in a square \
orientation. This made the website looker cooler. For \
the background I added a picure that I found online \
which added food shaped out as the background.

### Development
I kept the photos nice and clean and using the css code. \
I firstly had to import the pictures from online and move \
it to my Food Blog folder. I was then able to orientate \
by using margin left and margin top to move the picture 
to a specific spot. For the background I imported the
picture again into my Food Blog folder and using css \
I set it up as my background and centered it.

### Testing
When Interviewing others for their feedback someone commented \
that the website looked too simple and. They explained how \
the background was fairly simple and loocked plain. They also \
stated that the images are organsied in a unpleasing way. They \
also said that when you resize the tab, the images go all over the \
place and looked wonky. It would be better if the images were to \
also chnage size depending on the size of the tab.

### Improved
I partially agree with them as the images to need a rework, \
however, the background is prefectly fine. I think that the \
background is sutible because it is simply and it goes well \
with the rest of little details like text, buttons and images. \
It also shows the main theme and goes with the colours palette. \
However, I agree that the images need to be fixed. To fix the \
images, I added grids and added minimum and maximum so that \
the images would change according to the size of screen. \
The grid also made it easier to orientate the images into \
a clean square format. I also added borders and make the \
image responsive to make it fun and intriguing. 

---------------------------------------------------------

### Design 
I had Arial as my family font for my buttons, text and search \
bar. It made everything easy to read and gave a clean look. \
I thought it went well with the buttons and search bar so I \
chose Arial. Even though Arial is not a fancy font, I thought \
that it would be better to use a more readable font. 

### Development
To simply use Arial I used css and typed family-font: Arial, \
This changed the default font to Arial and made it easier \
for me to read. 

### Testing
When I came across Rehan's prespective about the website, \
he pointed that the buttons, text and the search bar 
looked bland. He added that it looked simple. To improve \
it, he suggested to change the font because it gave a \
simple and easy look, however that was my original plan. \

### Improved
After a lot of thought I finally realised that it was too \
simple and made everything look weird in a way. I decided to
fix the issue by importing the lobster font to my html \
website. This improved the overall look of website and made \
everything less bland and created an intriguing food place look. \

---------------------------------------------------------

### conculsion
These changes were essential for my website to create a unqinue 
and appetizing look. I used html, css and javsrcipt to create \ 
the final look. The user can now toggle through pages with out \
being disapointed, read fancy text and look at the scrumptious \
pictures of food. These ideas were inspired by people's thought \
about the website.
