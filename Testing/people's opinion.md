### Feedfoward from others before the final outcome
- Allan said that my buttons look simple and outdated, \
  and it doesn't match the theme of nature an organic.

  I improved by adding green navigating responsive buttons \
  and a grey side bar. This made it easier to navigate
  through the website and matched the general theme of the
  website.

- Someone also commented that the website looked too simple \
  and doesn't look like a food blog website. \

  I worked on this by adding images to make the website more \
  engaging and adding text to fill in the empthyness.

- Rehan said that the text in gernal and on the buttons \
  looks bland and ugly. It is simply and doesn't give a \
  nice vibe.

  I fixed this by importing the lobster font to my \
  html website. This improves the overall look of \
  website and makes it less bland and greats an \
  intriguing text.

  These changes were essential for my website to create a
  unqinue and interesting look
