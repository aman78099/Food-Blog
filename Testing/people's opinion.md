## Feedfoward from others before the final outcome
### Design 
I designed simple white buttons with no effect. The main \
The purpose of the buttons is to toggle between pages, so \
I didn't add too much detail to the buttons. 

### Development
I added simple buttons to help the user navigate through \
different pages. This ensured that the user would be able to \
explore and know about the website. They would start with \
the home page and then, using the buttons, be able to switch \
to the Search page, About page, or Sponsors page. My buttons \
were small and white because I wanted a simple and clean look. \
Using CSS code, I made the width small, to 5% and the height \
at 4%. I set the background as white and didn't add any borders. 

### Testing
As a part of my testing, I interviewed Allan who is a coding \
expert, and he said my design did not match the rest of my \
website. He stated that my buttons looked simple and \
outdated, and it didn't match the theme of nature and \
organic, He also added that the buttons looked small \
and made the website's appearance weird.

### Improved
Listening to Allan made me realise that my website \
is too simple and outdated. I decided to improve by \
firstly redesigning the buttons and making them \
responsive. I made them green to match the theme, \
and I also added a grey side bar. This made it easier to \
navigate through the website and matched the general \
theme of the website.

---------------------------------------------------------

### Design 
I added a few pictures and arranged them in a square \
orientation. This made the website look cooler. For \
In the background, I added a picture that I found online, \
which added a food-shaped green silhouettes \
as the background. 

### Development
I kept the photos nice and clean, and using the CSS code. \
I first had to import the pictures from online and move \
them to my Food Blog folder. I was then able to orientate \
by using margin left and margin top to move the picture \
to a specific spot. For the background, I imported the \
picture again into my Food Blog folder and used CSS \
I set it up as my background and centered it. 

### Testing
When interviewing others for their feedback, someone \
commented that the website looked too simple. They explained \
how the background was fairly simple and looked plain. They \
also stated that the images are organized in an unpleasant way, \
and they said that when you resize the tab, the images go all \
over the place and look wonky. It would be better if the images \
were also to change size depending on the size of the tab. 

### Improved
I partially agree with them as the images do need a rework. \
However, the background is perfectly fine. I think that the \
background is suitable because it is simple and it goes well \
with the rest of the little details like text, buttons, and images. \
It also shows the main theme and goes with the colour palette. \
However, I agree that the images need to be fixed. To fix the \
images, I added grids and added minimum and maximum \
values so that the images would change according to the size \
of the screen. The grid also made it easier to orientate the \
images into a clean square format. I also added radius borders, \
and made the images responsive to make it fun and intriguing. 

---------------------------------------------------------

### Design 
I had Arial as my family font for my buttons, text, and search \
bar. It made everything easy to read and gave a clean look. \
I thought it went well with the buttons and search bar, so I \
chose Arial. Even though Arial is not a fancy font, I thought \
that it would be better to use a more readable font. 

### Development
To simply use Arial, I used CSS and typed family-font: Arial, \
this changed the default font to Arial and made it easier \
for me to read. 

### Testing
When I came across Rehan's perspective about the website, \
He pointed out that the buttons, text, and the search bar \
looked bland. He added that it looked simple. To improve \
it, he suggested to change the font because it gave a \
simple and easy look, however, that was my original plan. 

### Improved
After a lot of thought, I finally realised that it was too \
simple and made everything look weird in a way. I decided to \
fix the issue by importing the lobster font to my HTML \
website. This improved the overall look of the website and made \
Everything less bland and created an intriguing food place look. 

---------------------------------------------------------

### conculsion
These changes were essential for my website to create a unique \
and appetizing look. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create \
The final look. The user can now toggle through pages without \
being disappointed, read fancy text, and look at the scrumptious \
pictures of food. These ideas were inspired by people's thoughts \
About the website.
