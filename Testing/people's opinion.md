## Feedfoward from others before the final outcome
### Design 
I designed simple white buttons with no effect. The main \
purpose of the buttons is to toggle between pages so I \
I didn't add too much detail to the buttons.

### Development
I added simple buttons to help the user navigate through \
different pages. This ensured that user would be able to \
explore and know about the website. They would start with \
the home page and then using the buttons be able to swtich \
to Search page, About page or Sponsors page. My buttons \
are white small because I want a simply and clean look. \
using css code I made the width small a 5% and the height \
at 4%. I set background as white and didn't add any borders.

### Testing
As a part of my testing I interviewed Allan and he \
that my design did not match the rest of my website \
He stated that my buttons looked simple and outdated, \
and it didn't match the theme of nature an organic. \
He also added by saying that the buttons look small \
and made the website's appearence weird.

### Improved
Listening to allan made me realise that my website \
locked too simply and outdated. I decided to improve by \
firstly redesigning the buttons and making them \
responsive. I made them green to match with the theme \
and I also added a grey side bar. This made it easier to \
navigate through the website and matched the general \
theme of the website.

### Design 
I added a few pictures and arranged them in a square \
orientation. This made the website looker cooler. For \
the background I added a picure that I found online \
which added food shaped out as the background.

### Development
I kept the photos nice and clean and using the css code. \
I firstly had to import the pictures from online and move \
it to my Food Blog folder. I was then able to orientate \
by using margin left and margin top to move the picture 
to a specific spot. For the background I imported the
picture again into my Food Blog folder and using css \
I set it up as my background and centered it.

### Testing
When Interviewing others for their feedback someone commented \
that the website looked too simple and. They explained how \
the background was fairly simply and loocked plain. They also \
stated that the images are organsied in a unpleasing way. They \
also said that when you resize the tab, the images go all over the \
place and looked wonky. It would be better if the images were to \
also chnage size depending on the size of the tab.

### Improved
I partially agree with them as the images to need a rework, \
however, the background is prefectly fine. I think that the \
background is sutible because it is simply and it goes well \
with the rest of little details like text, buttons and images. \
It also shows the main theme and goes with the colours palette. \
I agree that the images need to be fixed.

- Rehan said that the text in gernal and on the buttons \
  looks bland and ugly. It is simply and doesn't give a \
  nice vibe.

  I fixed this by importing the lobster font to my \
  html website. This improves the overall look of \
  website and makes it less bland and greats an \
  intriguing text.

  These changes were essential for my website to create a
  unqinue and interesting look
