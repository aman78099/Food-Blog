## Feedfoward from others before the final outcome
### Design 
I designed simple white buttons with no effect. The main \
purpose of the buttons is to toggle between pages so I \
I didn't add too much detail to the buttons.

### Development
I added simple buttons to help the user navigate through \
different pages. This ensured that user would be able to \
explore and know about the website. They would start with \
the home page and then using the buttons be able to swtich \
to Search page, About page or Sponsors page. My buttons \
are white small because I want a simply and clean look. \
using css code I made the width small a 5% and the height \
at 4%. I set background as white and didn't add any borders.

### Testing
As a part of my testing I interviewed Allan and he \
that my design did not match the rest of my website \
He stated that my buttons looked simple and outdated, \
and it didn't match the theme of nature an organic. \
He also added by saying that the buttons look small \
and made the website's appearence weird.

### Improved
Listening to allan made me realise that my website \
locked too simply and outdated. I decided to improve by \ 
firstly redesigning the buttons and making them \
responsive. I made them green to match with the theme \
and I also added a grey side bar. This made it easier to \
navigate through the website and matched the general \
theme of the website.







### Design 
I added a few pictures and arranged them in a square \
orientation. This made the website looker cooler. For \
the background I added a picure that I found online \ 
which added food shaped out as the background.

### Development
I kept the photos nice and clean and using the css code. \
I firstly had to import the pictures from online and move \
it to my Food Blog folder. I was then able to orientate 
by using margin left and margin top to move the picture 
to a specific spot. For the background I imported the
picture again into my Food Blog folder and using css \
I set it up as my background and centered it.

### Testing
When asking others for their feedback someone commented
that the website looked too simple and. \

### Improved
  I worked on this by adding images to make the website more \
  engaging and adding text to fill in the empthyness.






- Rehan said that the text in gernal and on the buttons \
  looks bland and ugly. It is simply and doesn't give a \
  nice vibe.

  I fixed this by importing the lobster font to my \
  html website. This improves the overall look of \
  website and makes it less bland and greats an \
  intriguing text.

  These changes were essential for my website to create a
  unqinue and interesting look
