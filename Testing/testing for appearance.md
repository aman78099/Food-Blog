# Testing for appearence

### Why I chose this colour palette for my website
I chose a grey white and dark green palette to go with for my \
website. This gives the website a natural and organic look giving \
authentic and turstworthy feel. The colours also look balanced \
and create an appealing look.

### Why I chose to add images to my website
The different images show the diverse foods that the food blog \
includes. The images create a picture of what some of recipe \
are included in the food blog. The images also makes the \
website more appealing to look at and attracts more users.

### Why I added responsive buttons
The responsive buttons make the appearence simply and beautiful. \
This physically appealing to look at and bends in with the \
theme. This continues the theme of natural and organic look. \
The popping buttons add a cool visual t the website making \
the website more playful and exciting to look at. 

### WHy I chose the background
The backgroud plays a big role in the overall appearence \ 
of website. I chose a simple background that has white \
background
