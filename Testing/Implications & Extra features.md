# Implications:

## Accessibility
One of the most important implications of a website is accessibility, which ensures that every user can access and view the data, regardless of the device or browser they are using.

Accessibility is important because the person will struggle to use the website as they would need to use a specific device and browser to access the desired data. To prevent this I have used media queries to help with automatic resizing.

## Media Queries:
Media Queries are a CSS technique that has been used to make fully functional resizable pages. They are set to a specific minimum size and maximum size and when the view port is below that width CSS rule is applied. An example of this would be when you resize the homepage and make it smaller, the buttons will start to shrink by removing padding from all sizes and will try to match the size of the page. 

## Relative Units:
Relative Units are CSS measurements that depend on something else, like the size of the parent element, the viewport, or font size, instead of a fixed number of pixels. An example of this is percent, size if calculated relative to the parent element, for example, width: 50%. This makes the layouts more flexible because the element adapts to its container instead of having a fixed size.

## Intellectual property:
With my website I have respected intellectual property, in particular copyright of images
included in the website. I have used the images appropriately and clearly stated that the images included are not mine and used for education purposes by saying “Disclaimer: I do not own the rights to the photos or fonts used in this website. All rights belong to their respective owners. This site is for educational purposes only.” 

## Aesthetics:
Another important feature when making a website is its looks. An appealing website can engage the user and create a starting hook which forces the user to stay and further explore the page. Hence why aesthetics was one of my top priorities to hook the user and to create an appealing start.

I have implemented these in my website 
Imported and used Lobster for my fonts to look aesthetic and appealing.
Colour schemes that were used were grey, white and green to create a peaceful organic look.
Created navigation bar for easy access to different pages that are linked up together.
Use of images to create an exciting environment that is not just filled with words.


## End user considerations:
The end user consideration is thinking about the needs, abilities, and experiences of the people who will actually use the system, and designing the program so it works well for them.

My sister is a strong chef who always looks for new recipes and tries to make something yummy. I have gone through the website with her to see how she would interact with it, and she liked the layout and found the butter chicken recipe useful as she never actually made it. Therefore, I think that means the website is suitable for chefs who are looking for new recipes to explore.

## Future Proofing:
My Website includes HTML, CSS and Javascript which works on several different browsers, ensuring that it will be supported in the future. I have also added small chunks of comments at top of each individual code to help future developers understand what each code does.
