# Testing for code

### Why I used grids for the images
the grids helped me align the images into a 2x2 box to \
make appear neat and tidy. The grid also help align 
prefectly in the center without too much shifting.

### Font styling 
I chose to import Lobster into my html and use it.
Family font: lobster; was the intened outcome and 
I saw Arial, lobster on computer
