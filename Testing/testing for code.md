# Testing for code

### Why I used grids for the images
the grids helped me align the images into a 2x2 box to \
make appear neat and tidy. The grid also help align \
prefectly in the center without too much shifting. 

### Font styling 
I chose to import Lobster into my html and use it. \
Family font: lobster; was the intened outcome and \
I saw Arial, lobster; was the computer. This allows \
me to make the website more fun and appealing.

### Responsive buttons and search bar
I added buttons and the navigation bar to the different \
pages to make it easy and simple to find each page. \
This helps to user to search for recipes, learn about \ 
different sponsors and about the food blog itself.

### Purpose of code
The code helps create a working responsive website where \
users can search for their favourite recipes. The colours \
and the format comes together to create a thrilling \ 
environment where the user explores for new recipes. \
The only purpose is to serve as an helpful recipe book \ 
where anyone can easily find the recipes.
